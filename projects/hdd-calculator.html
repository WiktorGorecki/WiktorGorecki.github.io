            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>The HDD Calculator is a Python-based tool developed by Wiktor Górecki. It is designed to simulate and optimize storage on theoretical or simple HDD drives that can store a limited amount of binary data.</p>
            
            <p>The HDD Calculator offers the following capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simulation of binary data storage on theoretical or simple HDD models with a small storage capacity.</li>
                <li>Analysis of data allocation and optimization techniques within the limitations of the simulated drive.</li>
                <li>Optimization of data placement to maximize storage efficiency and utilization within the limited storage capacity.</li>
                <li>Visualization of data storage patterns and statistics.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This tool is intended for educational or experimental purposes, allowing users to explore the challenges and considerations involved in storing binary data on simple HDD drives with limited capacity. It provides insights into the optimization techniques and strategies that can be applied to maximize data storage efficiency within such constraints.</p>
